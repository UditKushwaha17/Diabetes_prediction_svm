# Diabetes_prediction_svm

- We import necessary libraries including pandas for data manipulation, train_test_split for splitting the data, SVC for Support Vector Classification, and accuracy_score for evaluating the model.
- We load the dataset (replace 'diabetes.csv' with your dataset) and separate features (X) from the target variable (y).
- The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
- We initialize the SVM model, train it on the training data, and make predictions on the test data.
- Finally, we calculate the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted outcomes with the actual outcomes.
